## My process

### Built with
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Dev Server 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to set up and utilize a map element. I used the 'react-leaflet' package, which was suitable for this small application. Additionally, I employed Tailwind for styling and adopted the Mobile-First workflow, as it's the default and better-suited option with Tailwind. I am satisfied with the resulting outcome.

### Continued development

This project was my first experience on Frontend Mentor. It involved a simple application with a few functionalities, making it a good starting point. While I recognize that the styling isn't perfect, I am determined to enhance it in my future projects. I plan to tackle more complex tasks step by step, aiming for gradual improvement.
